          <h2>Introduction:</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Ben Sandoval and for my project I have decided to learn
            HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This website is a visual representation of
            everything that I have learned so far.

            <h2>HTML:</h2>
            <p>
              HTML is a coding language that allows the programmer to start
              creating a website. Although it is a very powerful tool, if you
              were to only use HTML when trying to create your website it would
              be a very boring website, as HTML is kinda like the "skeleton" of
              a website. HTML offers a very limited selection for the
              customization part of a website and the main function of it is to
              structure your site with different sections, text, images, links,
              etc. In this website HTML was used to create every word you see as
              well as divide the website into different sections.

            <h2>CSS:</h2>
            <p>
              CSS is another coding language which is the part that makes the
              websites look appealing for the user. In CSS you are also able to
              animate anything you want to make the websites more interactive.
              CSS is like the "designer" of the website allowing full
              customization of anything you want. In this website CSS was used
              in order to add color, fonts, animations, etc.

            <h2>JavaScript:</h2>
            <p>
              JavaScript is yet another coding language which allows for all of
              the functionality of a website to happen such as making
              calculations, saving data, reading data, or sending data. While
              JavaScript is not required to have a nice looking, functioning
              website, it is something that you will need if youre making a site
              that has anything that requires processing. In this website I used
              JavaScript to populate the music page with all the songs that I
              pulled from my "Top Songs" playlist on spotify.

          <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
          <p>
            Creating a website is like creating a house. First you need to build
            the structure and framework with HTML. Once you get the structure
            done you're free to design and add appliances to the house so you
            use CSS to put up decorations and then to create a microwave you use
            JavaScript. There are so many websites out there and pretty much all
            of them use these three languages in order to meet their goals.
